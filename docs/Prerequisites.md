# Prerequisites

1. Get `Owner` or `Contributor` access to a Resource Group from your __admin__. This is where you will create the workspace and other required resources.

    If you dont have access, ask your __admin__.

    `az provider show -n Microsoft.ContainerInstance -o table`

    if not registered, run the below command (you need to be the subscription owner in order to execute this command successfully)

    `az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerInstance`
    
    If you dont have access, ask your __admin__.

3. If you don't have Azure DevOps account, [create](https://dev.azure.com) one
